# NVIcheckmate
Extension of the R-package checkmate for argument checking adapted to NVIverse

Extension of the R-package checkmate with functions for argument checking that are 
    adapted to NVIverse. The extensions are of two types:
    1 Wrappers around checkmate functions like assert_choice_nocase wrapping assert_choice. 
    2 New argument checks specific for NVIverse functions. 

NVIcheckmate intend to follow the same principles as checkmate concerning input and error messages. Functions and code from checkmate have been imported to facilitate this.
